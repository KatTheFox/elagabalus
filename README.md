### A Discord bot for the Enigma of Secret Histories

The Enigma of Secret Histories was a small puzzle game reminiscent of an ARG hosted by Weather Factory, the creators of Cultist Simulator and Book of Hours. However, for unknown reasons, it was shut down on January 26, 2023, with a statement that "it encouraged unusual behaviour from folk with boundary issues," so they had to retire it.

The puzzles involved searching various places on the web for names of various things, then entering them as urls on the Weather Factory website in a specific format. This method is obviously no longer possible, as the webpages have been taken down, and one major source of information (the Ligeia Club twitter account) has been deleted.

Due to the abrupt shutdown of the game, the ending was never reached. The community has to this day only solved 8 of 9 degrees, and only a few hints of the mysterious '.b' remain. However, thanks to the dedication of this community, all currently-solved content has been archived, and with the release of Book of Hours, all known puzzles are once again solvable.

Thus, I created Ligeia. Ligeia remembers all of the puzzles, and recreates them in the dedicated discord server. New players can once again solve the Enigma of Secret Histories, just in a slightly unconventional manner.

Ligeia has had one major update: a switch from hardcoded puzzles to a content loader that's capable of hosting multiple enigma sets at once. This is to allow the creation of custom "Enigma-like" puzzles by the community, for a contest that is currently ongoing in the Discord server.

For posterity, the Enigma rules are archived on [my website](https://katthefox.github.io/discord/ligeia). If you wish to try to solve the Enigma, join the Cultist Simulator Discord server (linked on Weather Factory's website, but not officially affiliated) and ask for an Invite to Noon in the proper channel.
